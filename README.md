========

My [Project Euler](http://projecteuler.net) solutions in 
[Haskell](http://www.haskell.org/haskellwiki/Haskell). Not necessarily 
very good solutions.

Project Euler isn't exactly a competition, but the 
[intent](http://projecteuler.net/about) is that particiants should figure
out solutions to the problems on their own. Since the answers to the first 
100+ solutions are easily available with a Google search, I see no harm in
making mine available as well.

It goes without saying that these solutions contain **SPOILERS** for 
those of you that care about such things. You have been warned.
