========

My [Project Euler][pe] solutions in [Haskell][hs]. Not necessarily very
good solutions.

Project Euler isn't exactly a competition, but the [intent][about] is
that particiants should figure out solutions to the problems on their own.
Since the first 100+ solutions are easily available with a
Google search, I see no harm in making mine available as well.

It goes without saying that these solutions contain **SPOILERS** for 
those of you that care about such things. You have been warned.
